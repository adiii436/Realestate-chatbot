# Real Estate Analysis Chatbot

This is a mini full-stack project developed as part of my academic assignment.

The system allows users to analyze real estate locality data using a simple chat-style query such as:

- Show me prices in Wakad
- Show demand trend for Hinjewadi
- Compare prices of areas

The project reads an Excel dataset, processes it, and displays:

✅ Summary of the analysis  
✅ Price trend chart  
✅ Data table
